ABSTRACT:

Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder that causes unintended or uncontrollable movements, such as shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination.
Symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking. 
They may also have mental and behavioral changes, sleep problems, depression, memory difficulties, and fatigue.
Older woman and her caregiver While virtually anyone could be at risk for developing Parkinson’s, some research studies suggest this disease affects more men than women.
It’s unclear why, but studies are underway to understand factors that may increase a person’s risk. 
One clear risk is age: Although most people with Parkinson’s first develop the disease after age 60, about 5% to 10% experience onset before the age of 50. 
Early-onset forms of Parkinson’s are often, but not always, inherited, and some forms have been linked to specific gene mutations.
Our goal is to quantify the visual appearance(using HOG method) of these drawings and then train a machine learning model to classify them. In this project, We are using, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) image descriptor along with a Random Forest classifier to automatically detect Parkinson’s disease in hand-drawn images of spirals and waves.
